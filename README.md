**Why I think my UI/UX is the best?**

- I have used **Vuetify** ```https://vuetifyjs.com/en/``` as my component library.
- It follows Google's ```Material Design``` pattern which is a great platform design especially for mobile application and web apps.
- The application's design is responsive for mobile devices.
- Simplistic yet detailed.

**Note**

I may have not finished all the features for a robust weather app, but I'm still happy to show an output for this time pressure coding challenge. :smile:
